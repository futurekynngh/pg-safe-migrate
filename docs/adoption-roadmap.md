# Adoption Roadmap — pg-safe-migrate

A practical plan to build genuine ecosystem traction and npm download metrics.

---

## Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1–2) ✅ DONE

- [x] Publish to npm (`pg-safe-migrate-core@0.1.0`, `pg-safe-migrate@0.2.0`)
- [x] Push to GitHub (`github.com/defnotwig/pg-safe-migrate`)
- [x] Comprehensive README with badges, quick start, feature table
- [x] 153 tests passing, strict TypeScript, dual ESM/CJS
- [x] GitHub Action wrapper
- [x] Integration docs (Prisma, Drizzle, Knex, TypeORM, Neon/Supabase/RDS)
- [x] Express + Next.js starter templates

---

## Phase 2: Visibility (Week 2–4)

### Content Marketing

- [ ] **Publish launch blog post** on Dev.to, Hashnode, Medium
  - Title: "pg-safe-migrate: Advisory Locks + Drift Detection + Safe Defaults for Node.js"
  - Content draft already at `content/launch-post.md`
- [ ] **Publish deep-dive post** on CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY
  - Content draft at `content/deep-dive-concurrently.md`
- [ ] **Post on Reddit**: r/node, r/PostgreSQL, r/typescript, r/webdev
- [ ] **Post on Hacker News**: Show HN

### Community Listings

- [ ] Submit PR to **awesome-nodejs** (https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-nodejs)
- [ ] Submit PR to **awesome-postgres** (https://github.com/dhamaniasad/awesome-postgres)
- [ ] Add to **npm search keywords** (already done in package.json)
- [ ] Add GitHub **topics**: `postgresql`, `migrations`, `database`, `cli`, `safety`, `linter`, `drift-detection`, `advisory-locks`, `nodejs`, `typescript`

### Social

- [ ] Twitter/X thread explaining the "why" — common PostgreSQL migration disasters
- [ ] LinkedIn post for engineering audience

---

## Phase 3: Ecosystem Integration (Week 3–6)

### Make It Easy to Adopt

- [ ] **npx init command**: `npx pg-safe-migrate init` already works — promote in docs
- [ ] **One-line CI setup**: Document the GitHub Action in marketplace-ready format
- [ ] **Migration from existing tools**: Write "Migrating from Knex" / "Migrating from node-pg-migrate" guides

### Build Downstream Dependents

- [ ] Publish **express-postgres-starter** as standalone template repo
- [ ] Publish **nextjs-postgres-starter** as standalone template repo
- [ ] Create a **Fastify starter template**
- [ ] Create a **NestJS starter template**
- [ ] Create a **create-t3-app** integration example

### GitHub Action Marketplace

- [ ] Publish the GitHub Action to the Marketplace
- [ ] Write Action-specific README with copy-paste YAML snippets
- [ ] Example workflows for popular CI services (CircleCI, GitLab CI)

---

## Phase 4: Community Building (Week 4–8)

### Engage Developers

- [ ] Add **"good first issue"** labels on GitHub for minor improvements
- [ ] Create a **Discussions** tab on GitHub for Q&A
- [ ] Respond to any issues/PRs within 24 hours
- [ ] Star the repo from personal accounts to seed visibility

### Conference/Meetup Presence

- [ ] Submit talk proposal to local Node.js meetup: "Safe PostgreSQL Migrations at Scale"
- [ ] Create a 5-minute lightning talk deck
- [ ] Record a YouTube walkthrough/demo

### Partnerships

- [ ] Reach out to Neon (serverless Postgres) for inclusion in their docs
- [ ] Reach out to Supabase for integration guide listing
- [ ] Contact popular Node.js course creators for potential mention

## Phase 5: Metric Milestones

| Metric                | Target | How to Track                |
| --------------------- | ------ | --------------------------- |
| npm weekly downloads  | 500+   | npmjs.com package page      |
| GitHub stars          | 100+   | GitHub                      |
| Downstream dependents | 10+    | npm "Dependents" tab        |
| GitHub Action users   | 20+    | Action marketplace installs |
| Blog post views       | 5,000+ | Dev.to/Hashnode analytics   |

## Key Differentiators to Emphasize

When promoting, always lead with the **unique combination** that no other Node.js tool provides:

1. **Advisory locks** — "Your CI runs 5 pods, 3 try to migrate simultaneously. pg-safe-migrate handles it."
2. **Drift detection** — "Someone edited a migration file after deployment. pg-safe-migrate catches it."
3. **Safe-defaults linting** — "10 rules that prevent the most common PostgreSQL migration disasters, with inline override support."

### Comparison Angles

| Tool               | Locks         | Drift      | Lint        | Transaction Policy   |
| ------------------ | ------------- | ---------- | ----------- | -------------------- |
| pg-safe-migrate    | ✅ Advisory   | ✅ SHA-256 | ✅ 10 rules | ✅ Auto/Always/Never |
| node-pg-migrate    | ❌            | ❌         | ❌          | ❌                   |
| Knex migrations    | ✅ Table lock | ❌         | ❌          | ❌                   |
| graphile-migrate   | ❌            | ✅ Hash    | ❌          | ❌                   |
| TypeORM migrations | ❌            | ❌         | ❌          | ❌                   |
| Prisma Migrate     | ✅ Advisory   | ✅ Hash    | ❌          | ❌                   |

## Timeline to Application

**Realistic timeline**: 6–12 weeks of consistent promotion to build enough metrics for a credible 2.2 application.

**Application sweet spot**: When you have 500+ weekly npm downloads, 100+ GitHub stars, and can point to at least a few downstream users in production.
